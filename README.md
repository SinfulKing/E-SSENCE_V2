## Introduction/Presentation

The intention behind this project is to experiment with State of the Art technologies and trying to link several fields, i.e AI, web development and blockchain technology.

Tackling art and image creation through a Diffusion model based on abstract images, then getting an original title using several models (one for getting the features of the image and another one for adapting the title to its features), then adding this as a part of a library to be used on a web page, adding the capacity to generate
pictures through the page itself and finally an option to store it on a blockchain (solana or ethereum).

## Requirements

This project requires python (version 3.12 was used but another version should be fine), jupyter notebook, and several extensions to run the code.

## Installation

- Create a virtual env \
 `python3 -m name /PATH`\
 `source name/bin/activate`\
(install the libraries here too, so tensorflow or tensorflow-gpu, tensorflow_addons, numpy, pandas, keras)\
- install jupyter notebook\
 `pip3 install jupyter`
- launch it and open the file generative_model_AU.ipynb\
 `jupyter notebook`
